I am just doing some trial and error with scss( Sassy CSS) I am using the commond line to compile my scss to css SCSS is really good and handy. Problem I am facing now is that I have to compile the Scss file to css for each and every line. I think by using some API It can be compiled easily( But I have not tried it yet) I will be Posting changes.
